/**
 * Stripe Connect supported countries.
 *
 * ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes for the countries where Stripe can create a
 * connected account and pay out. Auracles routes payouts through Stripe only
 * (Paystack is shelved), so this is the authoritative set for both
 * organization registration (`country`) and contributor payout onboarding.
 *
 * Codes are the value; names are display-only. Kept sorted by name so the
 * rendered dropdown reads alphabetically.
 *
 * Source: https://stripe.com/global — cross-border payouts availability.
 * Note: Nigeria (NG) is intentionally absent — Stripe Connect does not support
 * Nigerian payout accounts. Revisit if Paystack is reinstated.
